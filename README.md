## Project Overview
This project involves comprehensive analysis of customer churn for a fictional Telecommunications company. My primary objective as a Business Analyst was to  identify the key factors that leads to to customers attritions and provide actionable, data driven recommendations to help the company improve customers retentions. I conducted all analysis using Microsoft Excel.

## Key Features:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling of missing values, duplicates, and data types inconsistencies.
- **Pivot Table Analysis**: I detailed analysis of churn by contract types, services, and tenure.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: I created a dashboard with charts and tables providing a clear overview of churn patterns.
-**Data Driven Recommendations**: I conducted a prescriptive analysis that helps me translate the business insights into strategic business advice.

  ## Methodology, Data Structure, and Workflow.
To conduct this analysis, I followed a structured workflow to ensure data accuracy and clarity.
1. **Data Acquisition**: I begin this analysis by sourcing a raw dataset from Kaggle, which contains customers information including demographics, services, and churn status etc.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: My first step during this analysis was to clean the data. By using Excels built in tools to:
- Remove duplicate entries to ensure each row has a unique value.
- I identify and handle missing values by deleting the rows  and filling in the data based on logical assumptions.
- I corrected the data types to ensure all columns where formatted correctly for further analysis (e.g., numbers, text, dates).<br>


3. **Data Analysis**: I leveraged on Pivot Tables to summarized and analyze the cleaned data from different angles. This allowed me to quickly identify business patterns and relationships between variables, such as churn rates among different contracts types.<br>
4. **Dashboard Creation**: I designed an interactive dashboard that helps me present my key findings visually. I used pivot charts linked to pivot Tables to create dynamic visualizations that change based on the data.
